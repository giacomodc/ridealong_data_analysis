# Truck ride-along data processing and analysis
A truck ride-along consists in riding in a delivery truck with a local driver as observer. Ride-alongs are often performed by newly recruited drivers to learn from more experienced drivers.

Ride-alongs are a great way to learn first-hand how experienced drivers perform their job, and how urban deliveries are carried out. 

The objective of this work is to detail a data collection protocol to perform during a ride-along and report quantitative measures on the routes taken, parking choices and location and deliveries performed.

## Data collection protocol
During the ride-along, the observer will track him/herself using a GPS tracking mobile app installed on the personal mobile device. I used the Trails mobile app (https://trails.io/en/), a free-of-charge app used to track runs. GPS traces can be exported from the app at the end of the ride-along as a GPX file.

The attached R file contains code to analyze the GPX file and visualize the routes taken and compile different descriptive statistics.

Two samples of ride-along GPX files are attached.
