# Truck ride-along data processing and analysis
A truck ride-along consists in riding in a delivery truck with a local driver as observer. Ride-alongs are often performed by newly recruited drivers to learn from more experienced drivers who are knowledgeable about a specific delivery route in a city and the type of delivery and pick-up activities to be performed in that route.

As researcher studying urban logistics and e-commerce, ride-alongs are a great way to learn first-hand how experienced drivers perform their job, and how urban deliveries are carried out.

The objective of this work is to detail a data collection protocol to perform during a ride-along and report quantitative measures on the routes taken, parking choices and location and deliveries performed.
